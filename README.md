The board is 48mm wide and 44mm high. Manufacture of the boards and testing is a work in progress.

The board is designed to accommodate a readily available and inexpensive USB C 3.1 breakout board with a male connector, and two standard SUB type B connectors to allow assembly with simple through hole soldering.
